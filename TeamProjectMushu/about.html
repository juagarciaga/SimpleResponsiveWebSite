                    An Engineer dies and goes to hell. He looks around and sees that hell is in a state of disrepair and convinces Satan that he can make some improvements. Within two weeks he has air conditioning, elevators, and indoor plumbing throughout hell and the damned are starting to enjoy themselves.

                    God sees this and goes down to find out what happened. He gets the story from Satan and tells Satan that the engineer was obviously meant to go to heaven. Satan refuses to give up the engineer, saying “I like the way things are going.”

                    God says, “Give him back or I’ll sue the pants off you.”

                    Satan asks, “Where are you going to get a lawyer?”

                    Every problems needs two engineers:

                    One to find the solution for the problem and one to find the problem with the solution.

                    Four engineers were sitting around one day trying to figure out what kind of engineer God is.

                    The first engineer says “I think God is a Mechanical Engineer, because of joints, muscle and sense of balance.” The other three nod their heads and say “Yeah, could be.”

                    The second engineer says “I think God is an Electrical Engineer, because of the nervous system and neural network.” The other three nod their heads and say “Yeah, could be.”

                    The third engineer says “I think God is a Chemical Engineer, because of hormonal balances and metabolism.” The other three nod their heads and say “Yeah, could be.”

                    The fourth engineer snaps his fingers and shouts out “I know, God MUST be a Civil Engineer!”

                    The other three ask “Why?”

                    “Well” says the fourth engineer, “who else would put a waste water drainage right through a prime recreational area?”
